# Monsoon_project

This repository contains sample code files from a project assessing the skill of monsoon depression forecasts for two different models: IITM (developed in India) and ECMWF (developed in Europe).

The data analysis for this project was done before I had taken any formal data science classes, hence most of the code does not use Pandas for data manipulation. Additionally, many of the notebooks contained a lot of scratch work, so only a few are included here as samples.
